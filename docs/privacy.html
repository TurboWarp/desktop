      <h2>The website (https://desktop.turbowarp.org/)</h2>
      <p>The website does not log anything when you visit it.</p>
      <p>Download links on the website are stored on GitHub releases. GitHub maintains a public download count for these files.</p>

      <h2>The app</h2>
      <p>The app may make requests to check for updates. These requests are not logged. These requests can be disabled.</p>
      <p>Scratch extensions that require Wi-Fi (such as Translate, Text to Speech, LEGO, micro:bit, etc.) may connect to the Scratch API to implement these features. <a href="https://scratch.org/privacy_policy/">Refer to the Scratch privacy policy for more information</a>. The Translate extension may instead make requests to a TurboWarp API, which may then forward your request to the Scratch API and log the message being translated and the result for caching and performance.</p>

      <h3>Packager</h3>
      <p>The app contains an integrated version of the <a href="https://packager.turbowarp.org/">TurboWarp Packager</a>. This feature does not make any requests unless it's used.</p>
      <p>The packager may contact the Scratch API to download projects. See the <a href="https://scratch.org/privacy_policy/">Scratch privacy policy</a> for more information. If you configure the packager to package a project from a remote URL, you are subject to the privacy practices of that particular website. The packager may download large files such as Electron binaries from a remote server; these requests are not logged.</p>

      <h3>Output of packager ("packaged projects")</h3>
      <p>If the packaged project uses extensions that require Wi-Fi such as Translate, Text to Speech, LEGO, and micro:bit, then the project may connect to the Scratch API to implement these features. <a href="https://scratch.org/privacy_policy/">Refer to the Scratch privacy policy for more information</a>.</p>
      <p>If the packaged project uses the Translate extension or is configured to "Connect to cloud variable server", then the project may connect to servers controlled by TurboWarp. The project ID and username may be logged. <a href="https://turbowarp.org/privacy.html">Refer to the primary TurboWarp privacy policy for more information</a>.</p>
      <p>If the packaged project uses custom extensions, custom JS, or custom cloud host, contact the relevant maintainer for their privacy practices.</p>
      <p>You are responsible for informing end users about the privacy practices of the files you distribute. Do not link to this document as your project's privacy policy as it may change in the future; you should write your own using this section as a reference.</p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>Any concerns related to privacy or any other matter should be sent to: <a href="mailto:contact@turbowarp.org">contact@turbowarp.org</a></p>
